                The Revolutionary Government of Zanzibar (RGoZ) recognizes importance of PPPs in meeting an

                Department facilitates integration of PPPs in the national budgets with clear allocation of risks and
                responsibilities between the public and the private sector parties to the PPP agreement. By going so,
